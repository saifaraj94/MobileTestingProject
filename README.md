## ðŸ“– Project Overview
- **Duration:** 3 days
- **Team:** Groups of 4 QAs
- **Methodology:** Scrum (Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review)
- **Purpose:** Simulate real software development environment for QA testing and mobile automation

### Scrum Meetings
- **Sprint Planning:** 2 hours on Day 1 â€” analyze requirements, assign tasks
- **Daily Scrum:** 10 minutes daily â€” discuss progress and blockers
- **Sprint Review:** 1 hour on Day 3 â€” present work, receive feedback
