ðŸ“± Tasks.org Mobile Testing Project
----------------
ðŸ“– Project Overview

- This project demonstrates mobile manual and automation testing for the Tasks.org Android app using Appium, Java, and TestNG.

- It covers multiple workflows including task creation, sorting & grouping, subtasks management, search functionality, and error handling.

- Duration: 5 days

- Team: 4 QAs

- Methodology: Scrum (Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review)

- Purpose: Simulate a real software testing environment by analyzing requirements, designing manual test cases, and implementing mobile automation.

- Scrum Meetings:

  1. Sprint Planning: 2 hours on Day 1 â€” analyzed app features, divided workflows, and assigned tasks.

  2. Daily Scrum: 10 minutes daily â€” shared progress, discussed blockers.

  3. Sprint Review: 1 hour on Day 5 â€” presented final results, shared reports, and collected feedback.
